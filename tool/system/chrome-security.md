# Reason

Storing your password in Chrome can be highly risky due to the potential vulnerability if someone gains access to your Chrome device or password. To ensure a higher level of security, here are some recommendations for locally saving passwords in a more secure manner.

# Local Settings

## Password Manager

- Enable `Offer to save passwords`.
- Disable `Sign in automatically`.
- Enable `Use your screen lock when filling passwords`.

## Sync Settings

You and Google -> Sync -> Manage what you sync, disable syncing for Passwords.

# Cloud Account Settings

## Security

Manage your Google Account -> Security

- Set up 2-Step Verification.
- Revoke trust from unfamiliar devices.
- Remove devices that you don't recognize.

## Password Manager

Manage your Google Account -> Password Manager

- Delete passwords you no longer wish to sync.

# Final Steps

Following these steps, your account will be significantly more secure. You can now store passwords on your local device. However, remember that each time you save a password, you should remove it from your cloud account if you don't want it to be synchronized.
